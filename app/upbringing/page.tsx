          I was raised in a family where education, creativity, and strong values were always encouraged. From a young age, I developed a keen interest in art, colors, and decorating spaces. My parents always supported my imagination, inspiring me to make my surroundings beautiful and functional.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          During my school years, I actively participated in various art and craft competitions, winning several awards. Whether it was small decoration projects at home or event decorations at school, I always found opportunities to express my ideas and creativity.

          The support and positive environment provided by my family laid the foundation for my creative thinking and confidence. This is why I chose interior design as my career and continue to incorporate these values into every project I undertake.
